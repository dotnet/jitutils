# Assembly diffs

A valuable technique when developing the JIT is generating assembly code output with a
baseline compiler as well as with a compiler that has changes -- the "diff compiler"
-- and examining the generated code differences between the two. The tools described here
automate that process.

## Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have built CoreCLR.
See the [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) GitHub repo for directions on building.

## Assembly diff tools

* jit-diff - Driver tool that implements a common developer work flow.
  Allows specifying a configuration file to store common defaults, and
  implements a directory scheme for "installing" tools for use later.
* jit-dasm - Produce `*.dasm` from a compiler for an assembly
  or set of assemblies via prejitting. Used by jit-diff to do its work.
* jit-dasm-pmi - like `jit-dasm` but allows you to look at jitted code
  instead of prejitted code.
* jit-analyze - Compare and analyze `*.dasm` files from baseline/diff.
  Produces a report on diffs, total size regression/improvement, and
  size regression/improvement by file and method.

## Dependencies

* dotnet - The 2.1 dotnet CLI is used to build the tools. It is also used to determine the
  current processor architecture "RID". Install it from [here](https://dot.net).
* git - The jit-analyze tool uses `git diff` to check for textual differences since this is
  consistent across platforms, and fast. It is also used to determine if the current
  directory is a dotnet/coreclr repo root, to provide for default arguments.

## Build the tools

### The easy way

A `bootstrap.{cmd,sh}` script is provided in the jitutils root directory which will validate all tool dependencies,
build the repo, publish the resulting binaries to a common "bin" directory, and place them on the path.
This can be run to set up the developer in one shot.

### The flexible way

To build jitutils not using the bootstrap script:

* Run `dotnet restore` in the root (once).
* Run `build.{cmd,sh}`.

By default the script just builds the tools and does not publish them in a separate directory.
To publish the utilities add the '-p' flag which publishes each utility to the ./bin directory 
in the root of the repo.  Additionally, to download the default set of framework assemblies 
that can be used for generating asm diffs, add '-f'.

```
 $ ./build.sh -h

build.sh [-b <BUILD TYPE>] [-f] [-h] [-p] [-t <TARGET>]

    -b <BUILD TYPE> : Build type, can be Debug or Release.
    -h              : Show this message.
    -f              : Install default framework directory in <script_root>/fx.
    -p              : Publish utilities.
    -t <TARGET>     : Target framework. Default is netcoreapp2.0.
```

## 50,000 foot view

By default, assembly code output (aka, "dasm") is generated by running crossgen
with a specified JIT to compile a specified set of assemblies, by setting the
following JIT environment variables to generate the output:
* `COMPlus_NgenDisasm`
* `COMPlus_NgenUnwindDump`
* `COMPlus_NgenEHDump`
* `COMPlus_JitDiffableDasm`
* optionally, `COMPlus_NgenGCDump`

Generating "diffs" involves generating assembly code output for both a baseline
and a "diff" JIT, and comparing the results.

Passing the `--pmi` option to `jit-diffs` will instead use reflection to jit each
method in the assembly, setting these options:
* `COMPlus_JitDisasm`
* `COMPlus_JitUnwindDump`
* `COMPlus_JitEHDump`
* `COMPlus_JitDiffableDasm`
* `COMPlus_JitDisasmAssemblies`
* optionally, `COMPlus_JitGCDump`

## What can jit-diff produce asm diffs for?

jit-diff has built-in knowledge of how to generate asm diffs for the following
sets of assemblies:
* System.Private.CoreLib.dll. Use `-c` or `--corelib`.
* A set of about 130 .NET Core frameworks assemblies (including System.Private.CoreLib.dll).
  Use `-f` or `--frameworks`.
* The entire dotnet/coreclr test tree. Use `--tests`.
* Of the test tree, only the benchmarks. Use `--benchmarks`.
* An arbitrary assembly via `--assembly`.

`--corelib` is the default.

Only one of `--corelib` or `--frameworks` can be specified.

Only one of `--tests` or `--benchmarks` can be specified.

If `--tests` or `--benchmarks` is specified, you may also specify `--test_root` so the tool knows
where to find the test tree you wish to use, or use the computed default for `--test_root`.

To generate diffs for everything jit-diff knows how to diff, use both `--frameworks` and `--tests`.

## Jitting vs Prejitting

`jit-dasm` and `jit-dasm-pmi` provide complementary views of the impact of a jit
change on generated code. For a robust assessment of the impact of a jit change
you may need to run diffs both ways.

The jit will produce different code when jitting than when prejitting and will
produce code for somewhat different sets of methods.

### Prejitting

* Prejitted code interacts with the runtime differently, and has restrictions
on cross assembly inlining.
* Generic methods and methods defined in generic types may not get prejitted.
* Methods using SIMD (`Vector<T>`) and methods using hardware intrinsics will
not be prejitted.
* Methods using generic types or methods from other assemblies may not get
prejitted.

### Jitting

* Methods that are prejitted generally won't be jitted.
* `jit-dasm-pmi` uses heuristics to try and cover generic types and methods that
give a basic but simplistic view of possible instantations.

## Preparing to generate diffs

First, you must build the dotnet/coreclr repo to produce a crossgen and a JIT (e.g., clrjit.dll).
You also need to have a baseline crossgen / JIT available. One way to do this is to have a separate
clone of the dotnet/coreclr repro that is identical to your working / "diff" clone, except that it
has no changes made to it. For example, you might have these two directories:
* `c:\coreclr` - main development directory; clone of dotnet/coreclr. This is where you work.
* `c:\coreclr_base` - a "baseline" clone of dotnet/coreclr that matches the source of your main
  development directory except for your experimental changes to the JIT.

Build both of these directories with the same architecture and build flavor (e.g., x64 checked),
producing the compilers to compare.

Also, if you want to generate diffs using the assemblies in the test tree, build the tests in the
"diff" tree (e.g., in the example above, `c:\coreclr`).

Ensure the jitutils tools are built, and jit-diff, jit-analyze, and jit-dasm are on the path.

      jit-diff diff --base --diff
          Does the same as the prevous example (if run from c:\coreclr tree), but uses
          default c:\coreclr\bin\diffs output directory, and `base_root` must be specified
          in the config.json file in the directory pointed to by the JIT_UTILS_ROOT
          environment variable.
    
      jit-diff diff --diff

      jit-diff diff --diff --build Debug
          Generate diffs, but using a Debug build, even if there is a Checked build available.

## Examples of generating diffs

The tool needs to know:
* Which base and diff JIT and crossgen or corerun to use.
* Which assemblies to generate dasm for.
* Where to put the generated dasm.
* Whether or not you want diffs for prejitted code (default) or jitted code (via `--pmi`)

These can all be specified explicitly. For example:

```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --output c:\diffs --corelib --core_root c:\coreclr\bin\tests\Windows_NT.x64.release\Tests\Core_Root --base e:\coreclr2\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.checked --diff c:\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.checked --crossgen c:\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.release
```

Explanation:
1. `--output c:\diffs` -- specify the root directory where diffs will be placed.
2. `--corelib` -- generate diffs using System.Private.CoreLib.dll.
3. `--core_root` -- specify the `CORE_ROOT` directory (the "test layout"). Used to specify to crossgen
   where the platform assemblies are. Also, used as the directory where framework assemblies such as
   System.Runtime.dll can be found for the purpose of using them to generate dasm.
4. `--base` -- specify the directory in which a baseline JIT can be found.
5. `--diff` -- specify the directory in which a diff (experimental) JIT can be found.
6. `--crossgen` -- specify the crossgen.exe or crossgen2.exe to use. Note that this must match the build flavor of `--core_root`.

You create the `CORE_ROOT` directory "layout" by running the runtest script.
On Windows, this can be created by running the following in the dotnet/coreclr repo root.
```
    c:\coreclr> tests\runtest.cmd
```
or
```
    c:\coreclr> tests\runtest.cmd GenerateLayoutOnly
```
On non-Windows, consult the test instructions
[here](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/unix-test-instructions.md).
Note that you can pass `--testDir=NONE` to runtest.sh to get the
same effect as passing `GenerateLayoutOnly` to runtest.cmd on Windows.

The above jit-diff command will generate both baseline and diff asm code into the specified output directory.
It will automatically create a unique named subdirectory (if the `--tag` switch isn't specified to override the default name),
and within that subdirectory will be "base" and "diff" directories, containing the diffs. The default subdirectory
name looks like `dasmset_12`, with a unique number for every run of jit-diff.

jit-analyze will be run to compare the generated output if both baseline and diff asm are generated.

You can also run a recursive textual comparison tool like windiff on Windows to visually compare
the diffs, e.g.:
```
    c:\coreclr> windiff c:\diffs\dasmset_12\base c:\diffs\dasmset_12\diff
```

## Simplified jit-diff usage: defaults

As seen above, specifying all required information can be quite verbose. jit-diff
can automatically determine most of the arguments using computed defaults. The
above diff can be accomplished using simply:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --diff --base --base_root e:\coreclr2
```

You minimally specify:
* `--diff` with no argument to request the diff compiler be used to generate asm (to a "diff" directory).
* `--base` with no argument to request the baseline compiler be used to generate asm (to a "base" directory).
* `--base_root` to specify the dotnet/coreclr repo root that contains the baseline build.

The defaults are:
* If jit-diff is invoked with the current directory within the dotnet/coreclr repo, then the root of
  this repo serves to find the diff compiler and `CORE_ROOT` directory. (Note that we have no reasonable
  default for determining what the baseline toolset or repo is. This is specified with the `--base_root`
  argument or by providing a full path with the `--base` argument.)
* The default output directory is `<repo_root>\bin\diffs` (in this case, c:\coreclr\bin\diffs).
* The default architecture is x64. If this isn't found, x86 is tried.
* The default diff and baseline JIT build flavor is checked. If this isn't found, debug is tried.
  (Both baseline and diff must be the same flavor.)
* By default, diffs are done using System.Private.CoreLib.dll. (That is, `--corelib` is the default.)
* By default, a release build is used for `--core_root` and `--test_root`. If not available,
  it falls back to checked or debug (but gives a warning that release is preferred).

To instead do diffs over the framework assemblies (not just System.Private.CoreLib.dll), using an x86
debug build, run:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --base --diff --frameworks --arch x86 --build debug --base_root e:\coreclr2
```

To simplify this more, create a dotnet/coreclr repo clone that you will always use for baselines.
Create a configuration file that specifies your baseline root directory, specifying a `base_root`
default. See the document [configuring defaults](config.md) for details.

With a `--base_root` default in the config.json file, you can simply run:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --base --diff
```
to generate diffs using all the defaults.

If you only want to generate asm from the diff compiler, omit the `--base` argument, e.g.:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --diff
```

Similarly, only pass `--base` to generate baselines (although in this case you also must specify
`--base_root` so the tool can find the baseline).

The following command-line argument are used to adjust the defaults, such as specifying x86 diffs
instead of x64 diffs. They are not otherwise required.
* `--base_root`
* `--diff_root`
* `--arch`
* `--build`

## Simplified jit-diff usage with PMI

The various simplified jit-diff invocations above can also be used to invoke diffs
for jitted code by adding `--pmi` as an additional argument. For example:

Analyze difference in jit codegen for methods in corelib:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --pmi --diff --base --base_root e:\coreclr2
```

Or, disassemble the jitted code for all the methods in `mytest.exe`:
```
    c:\coreclr> jit-diff diff --pmi --diff --assembly mytest.exe
```

Note this latter run should produce similar disassembly as running `mytest.exe` via
corerun (with appropriate COMPlus flags set) for the methods that are executed
during the run. But `jit-diff diff -pmi` will attempt to show code generated for
all methods, executed or not. And it also works on libraries which are not
directly executable on their own. So PMI offers a potentially faster and more
comprehensive view of jit codegen.

## Using tags

jit-diff takes an optional '--tag' command-line argument.  This tag can be used to label different
directories of `*.dasm` in the output directory so multiple runs can be done.
This supports a scenario like the following:

* Build base CoreCLR
* Produce baseline diffs by invoking the tool with '--base'
* Make changes to CoreCLR JIT subdirectory to fix a bug.
* Produce tagged output by invoking `jit-diff --diff ...  --tag bugfix1`
* Make changes to CoreCLR JIT subdirectory to address review feedback/throughput issue.
* Produce tagged output by invoking `jit-diff --diff ... --tag reviewed1`
* Address more review feedback in CoreCLR JIT.
* Produce tagged output by invoking `jit-diff --diff ... --tag reviewed_final`
* ...

## Analyzing diffs: jit-analyze

The jitutils suite includes the jit-analyze tool for analyzing diffs produced by the jit-diff/jit-dasm
utilities. It is automatically run, by default, when `jit-diff diff --base --diff` is used.

jit-analyze cracks the generated baseline and diff `*.dasm` files and computes the code size difference
between the two based on the output produced
by the JIT.  This data is keyed by file and method name - for instance two files with
different names will not be compared even if passed as the base and diff since the tool is looking
to identify files missing from the base dataset versus the diff dataset.

For the simplest case just point the tool at a base and diff directory produce by jit-diff and it
will summarize code size differences across the whole diff. This is what the jit-diff command lines in
the previous section do.

On a significant set of diffs it will produce output like the following:

```
$ jit-analyze --base ~/Work/dotnet/output/base --diff ~/Work/dotnet/output/diff --recursive
Found files with textual diffs.

## jit-dasm-pmi

This is a general tool to produce jitted assembly output for compiled MSIL
assemblies.

Sample help command line:
```
    $ jit-dasm-pmi --help
    usage: jit-dasm-pmi [--altjit <arg>] [-c <arg>] [-j <arg>] [-o <arg>]
                [-f <arg>] [--gcinfo] [-v] [-r] [-p <arg>...] [--]
                <assembly>...

    --altjit <arg>             If set, the name of the altjit to use
                               (e.g., protononjit.dll).
    -c, --corerun <arg>        The corerun driver exe.
    -j, --jit <arg>            The full path to the jit library.
    -o, --output <arg>         The output path.
    -f, --file <arg>           Name of file to take list of assemblies
                               from. Both a file and assembly list can
                               be used.
    --gcinfo                   Add GC info to the disasm output.
    -v, --verbose              Enable verbose output.
    -r, --recursive            Scan directories recursively.
    -p, --platform <arg>...    Path to platform assemblies
    <assembly>...              The list of assemblies or directories to
                               scan for assemblies.

## packages

This is a skeleton project that exists to pull down a predictable set of framework 
assemblies and publish them in the root in the subdirectory './fx'.  Today this is 
set to the NetCoreApp1.0 frameworks.  When this package is installed 
via the `build.{cmd|sh}` script this set can be used on any supported platform for 
diffing.  Note: The mscorlib.dll is removed, as this assembly should be updated from 
the selected base runtime that is under test, for consistency. To add particular packages 
to the set you diff, add their dependencies to the project.json in this project and 
they will be pulled in and published in the standalone directory './fx'.
