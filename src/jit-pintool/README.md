# clrjit pintool

This directory contains the source code of a pintool that can be used with
[PIN](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html)
to measure throughput of the JIT on x64 and x86. The pintool counts the number
of instructions executed inside the JIT only. Furthermore it has some special
support to integrate with SuperPMI's metric collection to allow support for
diffing throughput.

## Building
The easiest way to build it is to follow PIN's manual and adding the pintool
here as another example. See the "Building the Example Tools" and "Building Your
Own Tool" sections in the manual.
Note that this requires cygwin on Windows.
